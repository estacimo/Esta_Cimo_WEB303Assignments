			Bender Bending Rodríguez, (born September 4, 2996), designated Bending Unit 22, and commonly known as Bender, is a bending unit created by a division
			of MomCorp in Tijuana, Mexico, and his serial number is 2716057. His mugshot id number is 01473. He is Fry's best friend.
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			Bender drinks copious amounts of alcohol to recharge his fuel cells, while displaying symptoms similar to intoxication when he stops drinking, even 
			sporting "five o'clock rust" around his mouth area.
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			Bender regularly emits "flaming burps," and "sometimes they aren't "burps". He gambles, smokes cigars, consorts with hookerbots, and has 100,000 terabytes
			of adult content on his hard drive.
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			He's constantly trying to gain attention, apparently to maintain his already over-inflated ego. He is equipped with Gaydar, though it typically indicates
			that everyone is gay. He hates his "self-destruct sequence." He dies when shot only if the bullet goes all the way through him, he is seen once with a 
			bullet proof vest hanging inside his compartment, indicating that there is important machinery at the back of bending units' chest compartments.
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			He lives with Fry in his closet-sized apartment, fully equipped with an apartment-sized closet.
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			He has an affinity for turtles (as they both can't get off their back), penguins, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Bender was made Pharaoh on the planet O'Cyris
			IV, but his servants, fed up with inhumane treatment, sent him to his grave (before he actually died).
			</section>

			<section>
			Bender is defined as a hedonistic, crude, thuggish anarchist with absolutely no self-restraint or inhibitions. He will pursue whatever target he sets his
			mind to and rarely will allow concerns over others get in his way. He is a deadpan snarker who possesses a razor-sharp wit, having a pitch-black sense of
			humor rooted in other people's misfortune. He is incredibly crass and vulgar, but at least he doesn't waste time with pretences and in contrast to Fry, he
			is substantially more emotionally mature and competent when performing tasks. He often builds himself up as a sociopath but despite this, pangs of empathy
			overcome him and he's far more doting and attentive towards his friends than he'd like to admit. He generally carries a veneer of a selfish and insensitive
			robot who usually cares about no one except himself. He has been known for getting the Planet Express Crew into a lot of trouble due to his scheming, yet 
			rarely shows any signs of remorse. Bender has no problem committing most crimes, and will gladly do so, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to more 
			serious crimes like kidnapping Jay Leno's Head due to their long feud. Moreover, he also does not have one slight grain of sympathy for anyone on Earth,
			with two exceptions: Turtles, because he identifies with them, and Fry, whom he considers to be his best friend; at Fry's "funeral," he even admitted that
			whenever he said "Kill all humans," he would quietly amend it with "Except one."
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			Though usually rude and selfish, Bender does have a rarely seen soft side. More than once he has saved Fry's life. He was genuinely hurt when Fry kicked him
			out of their apartment because he was interfering with the TV. He once saved the world from an evil sun flame and no one but Fry knew. He supported Fry's 
			playing of the Holophonor, going so far as to attend one of Fry's concerts. He even shed a tear when Fry told him he was going to propose to Leela, saying
			"He's all grown up". The rest of the crew are aware of Bender's emotional side and enjoy his hardened, crude exterior and a sardonic sense of humor, even if
			it's geared at their expense. They know that at the crunch, Bender ultimately can be depended on to do the right thing.
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			In general, though, Bender's behavior is defined by a rude and brash nature as well as excessive use of foul language. He also has many vices: He smokes 
			(because it makes him look cool), has done electricity (jacking on), and has had many romantic and sexual relations with women who are usually robots like him.
			He also drinks heavily; technically, though, this is not a vice, as alcohol fuels his power cells—if he was not a robot his behavior would be classified as 
			'alcoholic' but he needs alcohol to stay sober, and has on occasion been known to not-drink to excess and become 'drunk.' Bender is also a kleptomaniac, and
			can often be seen looting and thieving from his friends and co-workers, especially Amy, who is Bender's favorite thieving victim because she and her parents 
			are rich. He is also an accomplished con artist, having gained Fry's power of attorney.
			</section> 
			
			<section>
			Bender is a strong proponent for robots obtaining human rights, and gets very upset when he hears people claiming that human life is more important than robot
			life. When he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, bricks have been seen to fall from his backside on at least one occasion (a reference to the line "shitting
			bricks."). A brick-shaped chute can be seen on his uncovered underside while looking for his missing parts after being stripped down at a chop-shop. He has 
			also shown the qualities of an avid shutterbug: When he is sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, claiming that the
			event is "neat."

			Bender was built in the year 2996 in Tijuana, Mexico. He was built without a backup unit, which is meant to help him back up data so that if his body
			were destroyed he could upload his data into another body if he wants. Without this unit, Bender was recognized as defective and in order not to tarnish
			Mom's Company he would need to be destroyed.
			</section>
			
			<section>
			However, Hermes (who worked at Mom's Robot Company as a bureaucrat back then) was in charge of destroying defective robots and chose not to kill Bender.
			He authorized Bender's approval and Bender left the factory defective and mortal; however, in the episode "Ghost in the Machines" Bender can possess all
			electronics (as a robot ghost), meaning he was at least theoretically capable of backing himself up.
			</section>
			
			<section>
			As a bending unit, he spent his life before he met Fry bending girders to be used for Suicide booths. After learning this, he tried to kill himself but
			was unsuccessful.
			</section>
			
			<section>
			Fry then suggests Bender take charge of his own life, a suggestion Bender categorically rejects. A second later. he breaks a light bulb with his antenna,
			receives an electric jolt, and suddenly agrees with Fry's advice. The rest is history.
			</section>
			
			<section>
			Along with Leela and Fry, he joined Planet Express as a crew member on January 1, 3000.

				Bending and stealing. He also practices (stage) magic and can speak penguin and Space Bee. Having a robot body, he is also much more durable than a human.
				</section>
			
				<section>
				Bender's chest cavity could be considered a magic satchel, as it has been shown to be able to hold a whole human, inhuman torch; at least two heads; cigars
				and even the riches of an entire kingdom.
				</section>
			
				<section>
				In "Insane in the Mainframe", Bender speaks French (considered a dead language in the 31st century) while pretending to think of himself as Napoleon, also
				greeting the crew by saying "bonjour", meaning "hello" in French. He can sing, as shown in "Bendin' in the Wind".
				</section>
			
				<section>
				Bender has a love for cooking. However, because he has no sense of taste, his food comes out terrible. He is very sensitive about this hobby as he broke 
				down sobbing and even ran away from Planet express after Fry and Leela harshly criticized his cooking in front of him in "30% Iron Chef".
				</section>
			
				<section>
				As the series progressed, it seems his cooking skills have improved a bit. He managed to make a cake for Nibbler and create an edible salad.
				</section>
			
				<section>
				Bender is also very good at tap dancing as shown in the episode "Stench and Stenchibility", where he comes in second place in a tap dance contest.
